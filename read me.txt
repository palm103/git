 Merge branch 'ta/doc-no-small-caps'

Update documentation to change "GIT" which was a poor-man's small
caps to "Git".  The latter was the intended spelling.

Also change "git" spelled in all-lowercase to "Git" when it refers
to the system as the whole or the concept it embodies, as opposed to
the command the end users would type.
